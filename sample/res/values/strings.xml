  <string name="wtf">Vaporwave is a musical genre that emerged in the early 2010s from indie dance
    genres such as seapunk, witch house, and chillwave. Although there is much diversity and
    ambiguity in its attitude and message, vaporwave sometimes serves as both a critique and a
    parody of consumerist society, \'80s yuppie culture, and new-age music, while sonically
    and aesthetically showcasing a curious nostalgic fascination with their artifacts.</string>
